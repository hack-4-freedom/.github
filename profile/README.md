# Hack4Freedom

Hack4Freedom is a women-focused hackathon series building open-source freedom technology across the Global South organized by Evento.

We bring together female software developers to learn, build, and ship tools using **Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and ecash** — technologies that expand financial freedom, privacy, and access in regions where they matter most.

Hack4Freedom is not a weekend hack. It is an education-first, execution-driven program designed to move participants from learning → building → contributing to real open-source projects.

## What We Build

Hack4Freedom projects are:
- Open-source by default
- Built on freedom tech (Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, ecash)
- Focused on real local problems
- Designed to live beyond the hackathon

Common themes include:
- Financial inclusion & local payments
- Privacy-preserving tools
- Savings, remittances, and community finance
- Censorship-resistant communication
- Infrastructure for women

## How Hack4Freedom Works

Each Hack4Freedom program runs over two weeks:

**Week 1 — Education & Ideation**
- Technical workshops led by experienced builders
- Deep dives into Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and ecash
- Team formation and problem discovery

**Week 2 — Building & Mentorship**
- Daily check-ins and mentor office hours
- Open-source development in public repos
- Continuous feedback and iteration

The program culminates in a **Demo Day**, where teams present working prototypes and publish their code.

## Hack4Freedom 2026 Cities

Hack4Freedom 2026 will take place in five cities across Africa and Brasil:

- São Paulo, Brazil
- Belo Horizonte, Brazil
- Lagos, Nigeria
- Nairobi, Kenya

## Open-Source First

All Hack4Freedom work happens in public.

This GitHub organization hosts:
- Hackathon repositories for each city
- Shared education resources
- Speaker and mentor materials
- Open-source projects built by participants

Participants apply by opening Issues in the relevant city repository. Projects, discussions, and progress remain public to encourage collaboration and long-term contribution.

## Who Hack4Freedom Is For

- Female software developers in the Global South
- Builders curious about Bitcoin and freedom tech
- Open-source contributors and maintainers
- Mentors and educators passionate about freedom tech

No prior Bitcoin experience is required — only curiosity, commitment, and a willingness to build in the open.
