# Hack4Freedom

Hack4Freedom is a women-focused hackathon series building open-source freedom technology across the 5 cities in Africa and Brasil - organized by Evento.

We bring together female software developers to learn, build, and ship tools using **Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and ecash** - technologies that expand financial freedom, privacy, and access in regions where they matter most.

Hack4Freedom is not a weekend hack. It is an education-first, execution-driven program designed to move participants from learning → building → contributing to real open-source projects.

Hack4Freedom exists to make freedom technology more inclusive, more global, and more human.
